        <p>This is my final project for the CS50 web programming course. It is a workout diary app that tries to respond to some of the challenges I have faced with more complex tracking apps.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-container" id="index-challenges">
        <h4>User Problems to solve</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Too much complexity in creating a plan for a workout</li>
            <li>Lack of flexibility in adjusting a workout once a workout has started</li>
            <li>Lack of intelligent switching between weight units to accomodate use of different machines in different gyms</li>
            <li>Inability to quickly and easily see history with an exercise, including PBs</li>
            <li>Inability to track my weight within the same app - a key reason why I work out</li>
            <li>Too much clutter with features I don't want, getting in the way of ones I do.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section-container" id="index-requirements">
        <h4> Requirements</h4>
        <p> The app tries to solve each of these challenges, with these basic requirements:

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Register/Login/Logout functions</li>
            <li>See a list of workout plans the user previously created</li>
            <li>Create a new workout plan</li>
            <li>Add new exercises that can be included in workout plans</li>
            <li>See a list of exercises the user has created</li>
            <li>View current personal bests for the exercises, and click in to see personal best history</li>
            <li>Select a workout plan to do as a workout that day</li>
            <li>Adjust a workout during the workout e.g. if a machine is not available</li>
            <li>See a list of all the workouts a user has done, and when</li>
            <li>Add a new weight for the user to track</li>
            <li>See a chart of the user's weight over time</li>
        </ol>
        I also wanted to try out using some simple CSS animations to learn how to do them.
